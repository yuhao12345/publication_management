I plan to construct a database containing the information of publications.

It will include the following entity sets:
journal=(journal name, journal abbr, impact factor, open source or not, acception rate)
Editor= (editor name, working year)
publishing_company=(name, established year, country of origin, offical website)

Relationship sets:
Each jounal has a list of editors.
Each journal belongs to a publishing company.
